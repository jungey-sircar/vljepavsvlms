Video is a hard modality to work with. You're dealing with more data, temporal complexity, and annotation workflows that don't scale. This workshop tackles a practical question: **given a large video dataset, how do you understand what's in it without manually watching thousands of clips?**

We work with a subset of [**Action100M preview**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.10592) [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2601.10592-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10592) — 1,144 YouTube videos, each clipped to 90 seconds, annotated with a hierarchical *Tree-of-Captions* structure produced by a fully automated AI pipeline. Every label in this dataset was written by a model. None of it was seen by a human annotator.

As AI-generated datasets become the norm, **the skill of interrogating machine-generated annotations is increasingly important**. This workshop shows you how to do that systematically.

## What We'll Build

|  | Question | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| 1. What We Were Given | What does this dataset claim to contain? | FiftyOne App |
| 2. Three Lenses | What does the raw data actually look like? | Qwen3-VL-Embedding, Molmo2, Sentence Transformers |
| 3. The Second Opinion | Does a second model agree with the first? | Qwen3-VL |
| 4. Measuring Agreement | How much do they agree, per sample? | Text Evaluation Plugin |

By the end, you'll have a **confidence map** of the dataset's annotations and a reusable workflow for understanding any video dataset with AI-generated labels.

## Setup

### Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Running on Google Colab?** Uninstall `torchcodec` after installing requirements — it conflicts with Colab's video decoding stack:
> ```bash
> pip uninstall torchcodec -y
> ```

### Flash Attention (Optional)

`flash-attn` is not included in `requirements.txt` because it requires a compatible CUDA environment and can take a while to build. It is **not required**, but will significantly speed up inference with the transformer-based models in this workshop. If your environment supports it:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

---

## Dataset

### Option A: Start from scratch (follow along with the notebook)

Download the base Action100M subset from [the Voxel51 Hugging Face org](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Voxel51/action100m_tiny_subset):

```python
from fiftyone.utils.huggingface import load_from_hub

dataset = load_from_hub(
    "Voxel51/action100m_tiny_subset",
    dataset_name="action100m",
    overwrite=True,
    persistent=True,
)
```

### Option B: Use the pre-enriched dataset

If your compute is limited, the fully enriched dataset (with all embeddings, model outputs, and evaluation scores from the notebook already computed) is [available here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/harpreetsahota/fo_video_workshop_enriched):

```python
from fiftyone.utils.huggingface import load_from_hub

dataset = load_from_hub(
    "harpreetsahota/fo_video_workshop_enriched",
    dataset_name="action100m_enriched",
    overwrite=True,
    persistent=True,
)
```

#### Natural language search with the enriched dataset

The enriched dataset includes Qwen3-VL-Embedding vectors. To use the natural language search feature in the FiftyOne App, you need to register and download the model locally so FiftyOne can use it for query encoding:

```python
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

foz.register_zoo_model_source(
    "https://github.com/harpreetsahota204/qwen3vl_embeddings",
    overwrite=True
)

foz.download_zoo_model(
    "https://github.com/harpreetsahota204/qwen3vl_embeddings",
    model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B",
)
```

## Plugins

This workshop uses three FiftyOne plugins. Install them before running the notebook.

### Text Evaluation Metrics

Used in Section 4 to compute per-sample agreement scores between model outputs:

```bash
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/harpreetsahota204/text_evaluation_metrics --overwrite
```

### Caption Viewer

Some captions in this dataset are long. This plugin renders any `StringField` in a formatted panel inside the FiftyOne App, making them much easier to read:

```bash
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/harpreetsahota204/caption_viewer --overwrite
```

### FiftyComfy (Experimental)

An experimental panel used to demonstrate a few additional workflows in the notebook:

```bash
fiftyone plugins download https://github.com/harpreetsahota204/FiftyComfy --overwrite
```
